# MelonGems 🍉💎  

MelonGems is a fork of the original [**PowerGems**](https://github.com/ISeal-plugin-developement/PowerGems) plugin, customized specifically for our **Watermelon SMP**. This plugin enhances gameplay by introducing unique gem-based mechanics, providing players with powerful abilities and rewards.  

## 🔧 Fixes & Improvements  
While forking PowerGems, we addressed several issues to ensure a smoother experience:  

- ✅ Fixed **NullPointerExceptions** that caused unexpected crashes.  
- ✅ Resolved issues with gem abilities not triggering correctly.  
- ✅ Improved performance and optimized event handling.  
- ✅ Enhanced compatibility with the latest Minecraft server versions.  

## 🍉 Why MelonGems?
